Welcome to the Supermarket Sales Excel Dashboard project! In this project, I have created an interactive and informative dashboard using open-source data from Kaggle. The dataset contains valuable insights into supermarket sales, customer behavior, and product performance. This readme will guide you through the project, helping you understand the goals, tools, and steps involved.

**Customer Insights:** Explore customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and loyalty patterns to better understand your target audience. <br />
**Product Analysis:** Analyze product performance, identify top-selling items, and track inventory levels. <br />
**Geographical Trends:** Visualize sales patterns across different store locations, regions, or cities. <br />

### Tools and Technologies
For this project, we utilized the following tools and technologies: <br />
**Microsoft Excel:** The dashboard is created using Microsoft Excel, making it accessible and familiar to a wide range of users. <br />
